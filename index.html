        <h4>VirtualBox Environment with Domain and File Sharing</h4>
        <p>
          I created a VirtualBox environment where I connected client Windows 10 computers to a Windows Server 2019, adding them to a domain after configuring Domain Services. I set up a shared folder that client computers could access and configured necessary Group Policies and Active Directory objects to manage the environment.

      <div>
        <h4>Restore-AD.ps1 Script for Active Directory Object Restoration</h4>
        <p>
          I developed a PowerShell script, <strong><a href="https://github.com/roberto01110100/Powershell/blob/main/Restore-AD.ps1" target="_blank">Restore-AD.ps1</a></strong>, which automates the restoration of Active Directory objects and users from a CSV file. This project demonstrates my ability to create and implement PowerShell scripts for system administration tasks.

        <h4>Networking Project at American University</h4>
        <p>
          In this project, I divided the 172.16.10.0/24 network into eight subnets using a /27 subnet mask. The subnets were assigned to different office departments, and VLANs were configured for management, marketing, accounting, and native purposes. I set up trunking between switches, configured inter-VLAN routing on routers, and implemented port security on access ports. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, I enabled OSPF for dynamic routing across routers, created and applied access control lists (ACLs) to restrict unauthorized access, and configured network devices with secure authentication and encrypted passwords. Remote administration was enabled via SSHv2 to ensure secure access to network devices.
